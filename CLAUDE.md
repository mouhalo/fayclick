# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FayClick V2 is a Next.js-based Progressive Web App (PWA) designed as a "Super App" for the Senegalese market. It targets four business segments: service providers (Prestataires), commerce, education (Scolaire), and real estate (Immobilier).

## Development Commands

### Core Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 3000
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Development Notes
- Always use port 3000 for development
- If port 3000 is in use, ask user for a screenshot to see the current result
- No test framework is currently configured

## Architecture & Technology Stack

### Framework & Core Technologies
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v3.4.1** for styling
- **React 19** with modern patterns

### Design System
- **Primary Colors**: Blue (#0ea5e9) and Orange (#f59e0b) palette
- **Typography**: Inter (body text) and Montserrat (headings) from Google Fonts
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with 5 breakpoints (xs: 480px, sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px, 2xl: 1536px)
- **Animations**: GPU-accelerated animations with custom Tailwind utilities

### Key Components Architecture

#### UI Components (`components/ui/`)
- `Button.tsx` - Button with gradient and glassmorphism variants
- `Card.tsx` - Card components with hover effects
- `Modal.tsx` - Modal with backdrop blur and animations

#### Pattern Components (`components/patterns/`)
- `ResponsiveCard` - Adaptive card layouts
- `PageContainer` - Responsive page wrappers
- `ResponsiveHeader` - Adaptive headers
- `TouchCarousel` - Touch-optimized carousels

#### Custom Hooks (`hooks/`)
- `useBreakpoint` - Responsive breakpoint detection
- `useTouch` - Touch gesture handling and capabilities

### Styling Conventions
- Use Tailwind utility classes primarily
- Custom CSS animations defined in `globals.css` with @layer utilities
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop-blur
- GPU-optimized animations with `will-change-transform`
- Adaptive particle systems based on screen size

### PWA Configuration
- PWA-ready with manifest.json configured
- Icons: favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon.png, icon-192.png, icon-512.png
- Metadata optimized for mobile and SEO
- Viewport configuration for safe areas

### File Structure Patterns
- App Router structure in `app/` directory
- Page components directly in app folders (page.tsx)
- Shared components in `components/` with pattern-based organization
- Centralized exports through index.ts files
- TypeScript interfaces co-located with components

### Performance Optimizations
- Bundle splitting configured in next.config.ts
- Image optimization enabled
- Font optimization with display: swap
- Webpack optimizations for production builds

### Development Conventions
- French language for UI text and comments
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- TypeScript strict mode
- Component composition over inheritance
- Atomic design principles for component organization

### Current Development Status
The project is in Phase 2 development with:
- âœ… Complete responsive design system
- âœ… Authentication pages (login/register)
- âœ… Landing page with business segments
- ðŸ”„ Working on eTicket responsive design adaptation
- ðŸ“‹ PWA features planned but not yet implemented

### Business Context
Target market: Senegal
User base: Small businesses across 4 sectors
Key features: Mobile money integration, offline capabilities, multi-language support (French primary)
